Flourish: https://public.flourish.studio/story/954/ 
Flourish is a visualization tool which allows us to visual data in many different forms such as a globe, map, graphs,etc.


Our project is addressing Prompt #4: Visualize Factors Related to Refugee Rates
We built this project using React.js in the Frontend and Python in the Backend.
We built an api using Flask in order to have a smooth-flowing front to back application.
We used Re-Charts,a React.js mapping tool/component, to make the globe so that the user has a more interactive experience.
Additionally, the globe allows the user to be able to click on any country and look at the refugee rates and how free the choosen country is. 
In the future, we plan to use Flourish,another visualization tool, to display the Refugee Rates as Flourish has many visually appealing charts and graphs, which will appeal to the public as well as be more interactive.
